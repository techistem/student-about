# **Student Data**

## **Overview**

This Student Data program is useful for teachers or administrators to manage student records easily. They can add new student data, view existing data, 
and have it all organized neatly in a Google Sheet.

It is built using Python and runs through the Code institute mock terminal on Heroku.

## **Planing Stage**

## **_User Stories:_**

As a user, I want to be able to:

1. As an administrator,
I want to add a new student's data so that their information is stored in the system.
2. As a teacher,
I want to view a list of all student data so that I can have an overview of all students in the system.
3. As a teacher,
I want to calculate a student's average grade so that I can assess their performance in the course.
4. As a teacher,
I want to filter students by lesson so that I can view the performance of students in a specific lesson.
5. As an administrator,
I want to update a student's information so that the data in the system remains accurate.
6. As an administrator,
I want to delete a student's data so that their information is removed from the system.

## **_Site Aims:_**

The site aims to:

1. Users can input student information, including name, surname, lesson, and exam scores.
2. Users can list and display student data from Google Sheets worksheet.
3. Describes how the program saves the entered student data to the worksheet.
4. Users are encouraged to provide feedback or report issues for program improvement.

## **_Path to Achieve:_** 

To achieve the above, the site will:

1. When the user enters information that is not valid, a message should appear on the screen explaining what to do and how to continue.
2. Create an option so that the user can check the information they enter.
3. Provide the user with the opportunity to easily view and delete the information they enter.

## **_Student Data Flow Chart:_**

I created the following flow chart using [lucid charts] (https://www.lucidchart.com/) to outline the necessary steps for programming
the student data recording system.
